GroceryView turns grocery prices into a market: every product is a **ticker** with a
price chart, chains/categories/brands have **indices**, deals get a **Buy/Wait**
rating, and shoppers **track, compare, and get alerted** across chains over time.

## 🛒 What shoppers get (consumer value)

The metrics a real shopper cares about — ✅ = core engine wired into the web app,
🔻 = engine ready, surfacing in progress. Every figure traces to real data + a
confidence indicator (never fabricated).

- **💰 Save up to ~47% right now** — biggest cross-chain price gap currently shown on the homepage (the headline "why use this").
- ✅ **Cheapest chain (Chain Price Index)** — who's cheapest, 100-centred, over time
- ✅ **Cheapest store for *my* basket** — store basket coverage + cost
- ✅ **Today's best deals / category deal leaders** — biggest real discounts now
- ✅ **Your personal grocery inflation (CPI)** — how *your* basket's cost is trending
- ✅ **Nutrition per krona** — most protein/calories per SEK
- ✅ **Budget vs premium (brand-tier index)** — how much the store-brand saves
- ✅ **Expiry / clearance deal radar** — cut waste, grab markdowns
- ✅ **Watchlist price-drop alerts** — follow a product, get told when it falls
- ✅ **Price-by-district map** — where shopping is cheaper near you

**Consumer-metric roadmap (highest-value, not yet live):** Deal Score + Buy/Wait
verdict · 52-week-low badge · price-drop movers board · data-freshness badge ·
loyalty/member-price-adjusted basket (the feature *no* rival has).
